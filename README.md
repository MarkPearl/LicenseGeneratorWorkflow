License Generator Workflow
==========================

License Gerator Workflow is a refactored example of a workflow for generating licenses using [CryptoLicensing](http://www.ssware.com/cryptolicensing) 

It's intention is to ultimately replace the example service that they have for interacting with PayPal - right now I am not happy with the structure of their codebase. 

This is an alternate approach that people can use.
